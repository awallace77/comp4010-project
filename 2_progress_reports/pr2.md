In the implementing environment phase (Oct 14 - Oct 27), each group member has contributed to the environment setup, implementation, and design.

Also, an agent has been implemented using the Q-Learning algorithm in our simplified environment. Lastly, the environment demo was completed with each group member contributing to the verbal presentation.

In the next two weeks, we will work on:

Training and Initial Results (Oct 28–Nov 10):

- Add features to the environment (e.g., tower level ups)
- Research RL algorithms (non-tabular)
- Begin implementation
- Submit progress report (Oct 30)
