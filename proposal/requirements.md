# Project Proposal Requirements

Due date: Sept. 28

The project proposal is worth 0% of the final grade -- it is only used to manage the projects.

Submit a single PDF file named "proposal.pdf" (without quote).

The proposal should include

Project title
Group member info (names, IDs, emails)
Problem statement: What do you want to work on?
Feasibility: Why is RL suitable for the problem?
Milestones: Write down a bi-weekly schedule on what should be finished.
References from the literature (at least four publications), showing how others have attempted the problem or what algorithms you are going to try. You can use Google Scholar to find papers. Highly cited papers could be more relevant, and papers with official implementation (e.g., with codes on GitHub) can accelerate your project.
No more than two pages, excluding references.

All students taking the course for credit must submit a proposal, one per group.

Clarifications on project ideas: There should be something unique to your project, whether something big like a new game/environment, a new algorithm, systematic experimentation, or something small like a new variant of an existing game, different reward structures, identifying new AI behaviour, etc. You could use pre-existing environments from the Internet (e.g., from the gym package or GitHub repos), but then we will expect you to do more in the algorithm design and result analysis. The bottom line is that we want to see your effort and contribution in, for example, the environment, algorithm, or experimentation. Grabbing everything online as your project won't be a good idea.
