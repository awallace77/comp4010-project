\section{Problem Statement}
We aim to develop and train a reinforcement learning agent to play an evolving tower defense game where strategic resource allocation and adaptive tower placement are critical for success. Unlike traditional tower defense games with manual upgrades, our environment features towers that automatically evolve and increase in strength based on the number of enemies they eliminate, creating a feedback loop between decisions and long-term strategy when it comes to positioning.\\

\noindent The agent must learn to place two types of towers: single target and area-of-effect. The environment will be grid-based with limited budget constraints per wave. As enemy waves progress with increasing health, the agent must balance immediate defensive needs with long-term tower development, deciding not only where to place towers but also which towers to prioritize for enemy elimination to maximize evolutionary potential.\\

\noindent This problem presents a few challenges: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Immediate survival against long-term tower development,
    \item Spatial reasoning for optimal tower placement on a constrained grid
    \item Resource allocation under budget constraints
    \item Adaptation to increasingly difficult enemy waves
\end{itemize}
The evolving tower mechanism introduces a novel aspect where early decisions significantly impact later capabilities, making this an interesting environment for a reinforcement learning algorithms that must learn both immediate responses and long-term strategic planning.
